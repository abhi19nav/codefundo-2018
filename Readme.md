## The Idea
Natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, cyclones occur every year, all over the world, and cause havoc in people's lives. Considering the scale of humans, we can't really do much to "prevent" such huge monsters. However, what we can do is to try to predict them, and then take proper steps for timely evacuation of the area, to minimize the impact as much as possible. However, predicting them, unfortunately, is not so easy and straightforward; and since mostly these disasters don't come with clear-cut prior notices, what is more important is to be able to create awareness and combat them once they suddenly arrive!

## Our Plan
Keeping the idea in mind, we are dividing our project into two parts:

### 1. Disaster Prediciton (Research based)
- We will use available data to train ML models to try to predict natural disasters - like earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, cyclones, hurricanes.
- Each one of them has different ways to try to predict them.
- For example, for cyclones and hurricanes, we might look at data on temperature variations, humidity content, wind directions and more. For earthquakes and volcanoes, we need to look at data on seismic activity. Volcanic eruptions can sometimes also follow some patterns in time, like once in two decades, once in a century, and so on.
- We would work on each kind of disaster, and try to see how reliable we can get in our predictions.

### 2. Disaster Response
This part is more on the practical side - to actually save lives!
We would create an Android based app to help the victims in events of disasters.
The core features of the app would be:
 - A news aggregator, that scans through popular news sites for possible upcoming disasters, and sounds an alarm to **alert the user** if there is imminent risk in his area.
 - An **intelligent chatbot**, that can interactively help users with immediate information needs in case of emergencies. Emergencies here include natural disasters as well as issues like road accidents, drowning, asthma attacks etc.
- An **SOS** option , to immediately contact relatives or call for professional help - fire-fighters, police stations, ambulance services, etc.
- The app would display **relevant news articles, disaster relief helplines and safety tips** to deal with the specific disaster.
- We would try to make as much **information** as possible - like helplines, safety tips - to be **available offline**, while keeping a low app size. The information can be kept up to date by updating it the next time device goes online.

We would keep looking into more and more possibilities for both the parts, and steer the project towards becoming an overall useful product!
